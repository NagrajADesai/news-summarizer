It is also reportedly hunting for showrooms in both cities.\\nAsia\\'s third largest economy offers an interesting growth opportunity for Tesla\\'s futuristic cars as its global EV sales plummet and competition from Chinese manufacturers gets more intense.\\nBut there\\'s a million-dollar question - can Tesla compete in India\\'s price-sensitive market?\\nTata Motors currently holds pole position in India\\'s EV market - with over 60% market share. MG Motors - jointly owned by India\\'s JSW and a Chinese firm - is second at 22%. They are followed by Mahindra and Mahindra.\\nEVs made by these companies cost less than half of what consumers will have to shell out - around $40,000 (Â£31,637) - for just the base model of Tesla. It will, therefore, be seen as a luxury car, competing with higher-end EVs made by Hyundai, BMW and Mercedes.\\nSimply in volume terms, this will make India a tiny market for Tesla chief Elon Musk, unless the company introduces a low-cost model specifically for the country.\\nBesides price, India\\'s road conditions could pose a challenge.\\nTesla cars have very low ground clearance - or the distance between the lowest point of the car\\'s undercarriage and the ground. This will make adapting to Indian roads difficult. To operate in the country, existing models may have to be re-engineered - which would drive up manufacturing costs.\\nWill Tesla do this just for one developing market where it could have only a small presence?\\n\"It\\'s been a challenge even with other global original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) at the high end with small volumes. You can\\'t justify these major engineering changes,\" Hormazd Sorabjee, editor of Autocar India magazine, told the BBC.\\nAlso, amidst all the hype, it is easy to forget that EV sales still make up less than 3% of overall passenger vehicle sales in India. Even critical ancillary infrastructure, like charging stations, have taken years to come up. While they have picked up pace, there are only around 25,000 charging stations across India.\\nIn effect, Tesla will be jostling for space in a very small, albeit growing, EV market.\\nBut at a policy level, India appears to be making every effort to woo the carmaker.\\nThe country has outlined an ambitious national vision to go electric. It plans to have 30% of private cars, 70% of commercial cars, 40% of buses and 80% of two and three-wheelers go electric by 2030. Most provincial governments have also established their own EV policies to incentivise demand and supply.\\nSubsidies offered by India on electric cars are also the highest among major economies, according to HSBC Securities. They amount to as much as 46% of the price of the country\\'s top-selling electric car model.\\nIt\\'s no surprise then that passenger EV sales have grown astronomically by over 2,000% in less than five years - going from a low base of 4,700 annually to a 100,000 cars.\\n\"The price difference between regular cars and EVs has reduced a lot, making customers rethink their choice,\" says Jyoti Gulia, founder of JMK Research.\\nIn April last year, India also cut import taxes on EVs for global carmakers which committed to investing $500m (Â£400m) and starting local production within three years.\\nTesla and other imported electric vehicles costing over $35,000 (Â£27,550) can now enjoy a lower import duty of 15% on up to 8,000 vehicles. This came after Musk complained that high import duties had prevented the firm from launching its cars in the world\\'s fastest-growing major economy.\\n\"It\\'s quite clever, as it forces a global player to localise - which is the way the game works: come and build in India,\" says Sorabjee.\\nThe proposed policy could put Indian domestic carmakers at a disadvantage, however, given that the investment requirement for foreign players is \"not significant\" compared to Indian players in this segment, an HSBC research paper warns.\\nImport duty of 15% is also \"much lower\" than the tax on comparable combustion engine cars in India which also pay an additional road tax, according to HSBC.\\nDomestic EV players say having a \"level playing field\" is important, but appear unperturbed by Tesla\\'s impending entry for now.\\n\"We welcome competition,\" Rajesh Jejurikar, Mahindra and Mahindra\\'s Executive Director and CEO, told the BBC. His company feels that more players will strengthen India\\'s existing EV ecosystem and is working to improve the appeal of their offerings.\\nCritical issues like \"range anxiety\" - the worry whether an EV\\'s battery charge will be enough to complete a journey - have been addressed through \"robust battery integration and rigorous real-world testing across diverse road conditions\", says Mr Jejurikar, adding that the brand is deploying cutting-edge technology into their product.\\nIt will be hard to beat Tesla\\'s edge in this area though, and coupled with sturdier batteries and a better user interface, it will certainly differentiate Tesla cars from others in the market, says Sorabjee.\\nWhat might also give Tesla tailwind is the rising share of premium vehicles in the Indian auto market. As a global brand with a perceived \"cool quotient\", owning a Tesla will be a status symbol for the young, aspirational Indian population.\\nBut none of this - India\\'s EV policy or the growing demand for premium cars among India\\'s affluent - has yet led to a commitment from Tesla to put manufacturing dollars into an EV facility.\\nFor now, it appears the carmaker will only ship units from its factories abroad.\\nWhen that changes will depend on a lot of things - how quickly India\\'s affluent consumer base widens, and what tariff structures look like once India completes trade negotiations with the US.\\nPresident Donald Trump has already voiced displeasure over Tesla potentially building a factory in India to avoid high tariffs. In an interview with Fox News recently, he said that this would be \"unfair\" to the US.\\nCould Trump\\'s \\'America First\\' policy diminish Musk\\'s appetite for starting manufacturing units in India then?\\nThe question is moot, but for now it does look like India will first get glitzy Tesla showrooms for its rich, rather than job-creating Tesla factories for its under-employed masses.'}, {'title': 'Tesla shares slump after European sales fall', 'text': 'Shares in electric car maker Tesla have slumped more than 9% after EU and UK sales fell by almost half in January.\\nThe drop in Tesla shares took the company\\'s valuation back below $1trn for the first time since November 2024.\\nTesla has been facing stiff competition in the European market from Chinese and other manufacturers.\\nIn addition, Tesla owner Elon Musk has been making controversial political waves on both sides of the Atlantic, an analyst said.\\nTesla sales in January bucked European electric car sale trends, which grew by more than a third in the month, according to trade body Acea, external.\\nInstead, Tesla sales across the EU, EFTA and the UK fell more than 45%, and more than 50% in the EU alone.\\nIt comes after Tesla sales fell last year for the first time in more than a decade as demand faltered and rivals gained pace.\\nThe main factor in the January sales slump was likely to be increasing competition, AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould said.\\nChinese manufacturer BYD has been making big strides, in part because it includes as standard some features which cost extra from other makers, Mould said.\\nHowever, some car buyers may also be taking a \"principled stand\" on Musk\\'s political interventions, he said.\\nMusk has made waves in the US with his involvement in slashing US development funds and efforts to drastically reduce US federal funding.\\nIn the UK he supports jailed far-right activist Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, also known as Tommy Robinson, and repeatedly criticised Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer.\\nMusk also supports the far-right AfD party in Germany, and congratulated its leader after the party\\'s record second-place result in elections.\\nAsked if the reason for Tesla\\'s share price slump was down to Musk being too toxic, a former senior director of the car maker\\'s Europe, Middle East and Asia division said it was \"definitely one of the reasons for the decline\", but added there was a \"cumulative number of things that are piling up a domino effect\".\\n\"There\\'s no doubt his flirting with the right in politics, running around on TV with a chainsaw is not exactly helping his image,\" Peter Bardenfleth-Hansen told the BBC\\'s Today programme.\\n\"He may be getting a bigger fanbase within a specific type of clientele, but they\\'re not the ones that are buying the Teslas. They\\'re not the ones putting money in to his company.

Across the continent, they were down 45% in January compared to the same month in 2024, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers\\' Association (ACEA).\\nThere has also been a steep decline in China â\\x80\\x93 a key market â\\x80\\x93 and Australia.\\nSome experts have said Tesla is over-valued, so the fall is seen as a correction, while others have pointed to rising competition from some of China\\'s electric vehicle companies.\\nInvestors are \"certainly getting more worried about an economic slowdown too, so the richest-valued companies like Tesla have been hit hardest in recent days\", Ms James said.\\nThere have also been concerns that Musk has not been focusing enough of his attention on his firms.\\nIn an interview with Fox Business on Monday, he said he was combining the Doge role with running his businesses \"with great difficulty\".\\nAlongside Tesla, his businesses include Space X, which has experienced serious failures in the last two launches of its giant Starship rocket, and the social media network X, which suffered an outage on Monday.\\nDespite his supportive comments, President Trump\\'s policies so far have been designed to limit electric car sales in the US, including revoking a 2021 order by former president Joe Biden that half of all car sales should be electric by 2030, and halting unspent government funds for charging stations.\\nTrump\\'s tariffs could also hurt the manufacturer. Tesla chief financial officer Vaibhav Taneja said in January that Tesla parts sourced from Canada and Mexico would be subject to the levies and that this could hit profitability.\\nTesla\\'s share price fall came against a broader US market slump on Monday as investors, concerned about the economic effects of Trump\\'s tariffs and weakening confidence in the economy, sold shares.\\nSign up for our Tech Decoded newsletter to follow the biggest developments in global technology, with analysis from BBC correspondents around the world.\\nOutside the UK?

Another car carried an \"Anti Elon Tesla Club\" sticker.\\nThe protests illustrate a growing unease over Musk\\'s influence on the US government since President Donald Trump allowed him to create the cost-cutting task force Department of Government Efficiency (Doge).\\nSo far, Doge has fired or offered buyouts to about 100,000 federal employees and gained access to the sensitive personal and financial information of millions of Americans.\\nCritics have resorted to calling the tech billionaire \"President Musk\", arguing that he has too much power in the White House. Some at the protest in Burbank held signs that said \"Deport Elon\" and \"Boycott Swasticar\" - with protesters attempting to connect the car to fascism.\\nTesla produced the must-have electric cars for many Americans with progressive views, but several protesters said they regretted their purchase after Musk involved himself with Trump and US politics.\\nKaren Rabwin, a protester at the Burbank Tesla on Sunday, attended just two days after trading in her Tesla for a Cadillac. She had slapped a bumper sticker on her old vehicle that read \"Bought This Car Before We Knew\" in a veiled reference to Musk, but she felt that wasn\\'t enough.\\n\"It was embarrassing,\" she said of driving the Tesla. \"It wasn\\'t what I stood for. How could I drive that car? I have principles.\"\\nSinger Sheryl Crow donated her Tesla to National Public Radio last month. She posted a video to Instagram waving goodbye to the car as it was towed away.\\n\"There comes a time when you have to decide who you are willing to align with. So long Tesla,\" Ms Crow wrote.\\nMusk has responded to the protests by sharing a video on X - the social media platform he owns - of a Cybertruck customer in Texas marvelling at the vehicle\\'s full self-driving mode.\\n\"Heartfelt thanks to everyone supporting Tesla, despite many attacks against our stores and offices,\" Musk wrote.\\nThe social media platform has many posts of Tesla owners showcasing their electric cars. But there are also now videos showing a growing trend of Cybertrucks vandalised with swastikas, used as skate ramps or covered in garbage.\\nDuring Mardi Gras in New Orleans, spectators booed an orange Cybertruck and pelted it with beads, calling the futuristic looking vehicle a \"Deplorean\" or other unfriendly monikers.\\nProtesters on Sunday said they want to take down Telsa\\'s value because they are concerned that Mr Musk is damaging the economy and the the country - and their efforts may be having an effect.\\nWhile Tesla\\'s share price surged after Trump was elected - with Musk by his side on election night in Florida - they have tumbled back to pre-election levels following the  backlash to Musk\\'s political involvement.\\nSome on Sunday also raised concerns that Musk\\'s government involvement is benefiting his businesses.\\nCritics note that the tech entrepeneur\\'s companies have billions of dollars of contracts with the US government, primarily with Nasa and the Defense Department, which are increasingly reliant on Musk\\'s SpaceX for satellite launches and space exploration.\\nLast week, reports claimed the Musk had attempted to get the Federal Aviation Administration to cancel a $2.4bn (Â£1.9bn) contract with Verizon to revamp the agency\\'s telecommunications system and awarding it to Starlink, a company owned by SpaceX, instead.\\nSpaceX denied that report, posting on X that \"Starlink is a possible partial fix to an aging system. There is no effort or intent for Starlink to \\'take over\\' any existing contract\".\\nSome constituents are furious at Musk\\'s involvement and the White House\\'s effort to cut certain jobs and programmes.

       " {'title': \"Can Tesla's EVs win over India's price-conscious buyers?\",\n",
       "  'text': 'After years of speculation, Tesla could finally be making its India debut.\\nThe American electric vehicle (EV) giant has begun hiring for a dozen jobs in Delhi and Mumbai. It is also reportedly hunting for showrooms in both cities.\\nAsia\\'s third largest economy offers an interesting growth opportunity for Tesla\\'s futuristic cars as its global EV sales plummet and competition from Chinese manufacturers gets more intense.\\nBut there\\'s a million-dollar question - can Tesla compete in India\\'s price-sensitive market?\\nTata Motors currently holds pole position in India\\'s EV market - with over 60% market share. MG Motors - jointly owned by India\\'s JSW and a Chinese firm - is second at 22%. They are followed by Mahindra and Mahindra.\\nEVs made by these companies cost less than half of what consumers will have to shell out - around $40,000 (Â£31,637) - for just the base model of Tesla. It will, therefore, be seen as a luxury car, competing with higher-end EVs made by Hyundai, BMW and Mercedes.\\nSimply in volume terms, this will make India a tiny market for Tesla chief Elon Musk, unless the company introduces a low-cost model specifically for the country.\\nBesides price, India\\'s road conditions could pose a challenge.\\nTesla cars have very low ground clearance - or the distance between the lowest point of the car\\'s undercarriage and the ground. This will make adapting to Indian roads difficult. To operate in the country, existing models may have to be re-engineered - which would drive up manufacturing costs.\\nWill Tesla do this just for one developing market where it could have only a small presence?\\n\"It\\'s been a challenge even with other global original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) at the high end with small volumes. You can\\'t justify these major engineering changes,\" Hormazd Sorabjee, editor of Autocar India magazine, told the BBC.\\nAlso, amidst all the hype, it is easy to forget that EV sales still make up less than 3% of overall passenger vehicle sales in India. Even critical ancillary infrastructure, like charging stations, have taken years to come up. While they have picked up pace, there are only around 25,000 charging stations across India.\\nIn effect, Tesla will be jostling for space in a very small, albeit growing, EV market.\\nBut at a policy level, India appears to be making every effort to woo the carmaker.\\nThe country has outlined an ambitious national vision to go electric. It plans to have 30% of private cars, 70% of commercial cars, 40% of buses and 80% of two and three-wheelers go electric by 2030. Most provincial governments have also established their own EV policies to incentivise demand and supply.\\nSubsidies offered by India on electric cars are also the highest among major economies, according to HSBC Securities. They amount to as much as 46% of the price of the country\\'s top-selling electric car model.\\nIt\\'s no surprise then that passenger EV sales have grown astronomically by over 2,000% in less than five years - going from a low base of 4,700 annually to a 100,000 cars.\\n\"The price difference between regular cars and EVs has reduced a lot, making customers rethink their choice,\" says Jyoti Gulia, founder of JMK Research.\\nIn April last year, India also cut import taxes on EVs for global carmakers which committed to investing $500m (Â£400m) and starting local production within three years.\\nTesla and other imported electric vehicles costing over $35,000 (Â£27,550) can now enjoy a lower import duty of 15% on up to 8,000 vehicles. This came after Musk complained that high import duties had prevented the firm from launching its cars in the world\\'s fastest-growing major economy.\\n\"It\\'s quite clever, as it forces a global player to localise - which is the way the game works: come and build in India,\" says Sorabjee.\\nThe proposed policy could put Indian domestic carmakers at a disadvantage, however, given that the investment requirement for foreign players is \"not significant\" compared to Indian players in this segment, an HSBC research paper warns.\\nImport duty of 15% is also \"much lower\" than the tax on comparable combustion engine cars in India which also pay an additional road tax, according to HSBC.\\nDomestic EV players say having a \"level playing field\" is important, but appear unperturbed by Tesla\\'s impending entry for now.\\n\"We welcome competition,\" Rajesh Jejurikar, Mahindra and Mahindra\\'s Executive Director and CEO, told the BBC. His company feels that more players will strengthen India\\'s existing EV ecosystem and is working to improve the appeal of their offerings.\\nCritical issues like \"range anxiety\" - the worry whether an EV\\'s battery charge will be enough to complete a journey - have been addressed through \"robust battery integration and rigorous real-world testing across diverse road conditions\", says Mr Jejurikar, adding that the brand is deploying cutting-edge technology into their product.\\nIt will be hard to beat Tesla\\'s edge in this area though, and coupled with sturdier batteries and a better user interface, it will certainly differentiate Tesla cars from others in the market, says Sorabjee.\\nWhat might also give Tesla tailwind is the rising share of premium vehicles in the Indian auto market. As a global brand with a perceived \"cool quotient\", owning a Tesla will be a status symbol for the young, aspirational Indian population.\\nBut none of this - India\\'s EV policy or the growing demand for premium cars among India\\'s affluent - has yet led to a commitment from Tesla to put manufacturing dollars into an EV facility.\\nFor now, it appears the carmaker will only ship units from its factories abroad.\\nWhen that changes will depend on a lot of things - how quickly India\\'s affluent consumer base widens, and what tariff structures look like once India completes trade negotiations with the US.\\nPresident Donald Trump has already voiced displeasure over Tesla potentially building a factory in India to avoid high tariffs. In an interview with Fox News recently, he said that this would be \"unfair\" to the US.\\nCould Trump\\'s \\'America First\\' policy diminish Musk\\'s appetite for starting manufacturing units in India then?\\nThe question is moot, but for now it does look like India will first get glitzy Tesla showrooms for its rich, rather than job-creating Tesla factories for its under-employed masses.'},\n",

      "[{'title': 'A key to protecting apples from climate change might be hiding in Michigan’s forests', 'text': 'In the quest to make apple trees more resilient in a warming climate, some Michigan researchers are looking for a late bloomer.\\nA native Michigan apple tree, the Malus coronaria, learned to fight frost by blooming two or three weeks later than the trees that produce cultivated varieties of apples like Honeycrisp or Red Delicious.\\n“That doesn’t sound like a lot, but almost always that’s enough for the flowers to escape the killing spring frost,” said Steve van Nocker, a Michigan State University professor and plant geneticist.\\nVan Nocker wants to identify the genes responsible for the Malus coronaria’s delayed blooms and use them to develop more frost-resistant apple varieties, a decades-long process. But first, he’s hiking through forests, trying to find the elusive trees.\\nVan Nocker’s project is one of many ways researchers and growers are trying to make apples more resilient as climate change makes weather less predictable.\\nIn Europe and South Korea, growers are experimenting with solar panels in vineyards and orchards. The panels protect fruit from hail and sun damage but also let in light and heat when necessary, said Jared Buono, the director of Cornell University’s Hudson Valley Research Lab. Buono’s lab is also adding solar panels to its experimental orchard.\\nUniversity of Maryland researchers recently announced the development of a more heat-tolerant apple variety. At Penn State University, a team built an unmanned vehicle with a propane-fueled heater that can roll through an orchard and automatically warm trees.\\n\\nBuono said such efforts can mitigate the impact of unusual weather like a May 18, 2023 frost that damaged trees across New York state and cut apple production by 20%.\\n“Growers’ jobs are already hard,” Buono said. “The change in climate, the increased unpredictability and variability, makes it that much harder.”\\nAccording to a Washington State University study published this month, major apple-growing counties in the top three U.S. apple-producing states -- Washington, Michigan and New York -- are seeing fewer cold days and more warm fall nights than they used to. Washington also is experiencing more extreme heat.\\nThe study, which examined climate data from 1979 to 2022, said the temperature trends could alter bloom timing, bring trees out of dormancy too early and increase the risk of sunburn, which hurts the appearance and quality of apples.\\nThat’s why, on a chilly day in December, van Nocker and graduate assistant Lily “Kaz” Christian hiked through a public park near Michigan State to check on a handful of Malus coronaria trees they had found there.\\nMalus coronaria – also called sweet crabapple -- was once so common in Michigan its blossoms were designated as the state flower in 1897. But the species appears to be in decline, van Nocker said. Parking lots and shopping centers now stand in many of the places where the tree was documented in the past, and the remaining trees often produce little new growth or fruit.\\nWhen they reached the trees, van Nocker and Christian cut off small pieces of the stems. The snippets will be tested to ensure they are fully Malus coronaria and not a hybrid. Then, these Malus coronaria cuttings — along with cuttings from previous hunts — will be grafted onto an apple rootstock.

       "[{'title': 'A key to protecting apples from climate change might be hiding in Michigan’s forests',\n",
       "  'text': 'In the quest to make apple trees more resilient in a warming climate, some Michigan researchers are looking for a late bloomer.\\nA native Michigan apple tree, the Malus coronaria, learned to fight frost by blooming two or three weeks later than the trees that produce cultivated varieties of apples like Honeycrisp or Red Delicious.\\n“That doesn’t sound like a lot, but almost always that’s enough for the flowers to escape the killing spring frost,” said Steve van Nocker, a Michigan State University professor and plant geneticist.\\nVan Nocker wants to identify the genes responsible for the Malus coronaria’s delayed blooms and use them to develop more frost-resistant apple varieties, a decades-long process. But first, he’s hiking through forests, trying to find the elusive trees.\\nVan Nocker’s project is one of many ways researchers and growers are trying to make apples more resilient as climate change makes weather less predictable.\\nIn Europe and South Korea, growers are experimenting with solar panels in vineyards and orchards. The panels protect fruit from hail and sun damage but also let in light and heat when necessary, said Jared Buono, the director of Cornell University’s Hudson Valley Research Lab. Buono’s lab is also adding solar panels to its experimental orchard.\\nUniversity of Maryland researchers recently announced the development of a more heat-tolerant apple variety. At Penn State University, a team built an unmanned vehicle with a propane-fueled heater that can roll through an orchard and automatically warm trees.\\n\\nBuono said such efforts can mitigate the impact of unusual weather like a May 18, 2023 frost that damaged trees across New York state and cut apple production by 20%.\\n“Growers’ jobs are already hard,” Buono said. “The change in climate, the increased unpredictability and variability, makes it that much harder.”\\nAccording to a Washington State University study published this month, major apple-growing counties in the top three U.S. apple-producing states -- Washington, Michigan and New York -- are seeing fewer cold days and more warm fall nights than they used to. Washington also is experiencing more extreme heat.\\nThe study, which examined climate data from 1979 to 2022, said the temperature trends could alter bloom timing, bring trees out of dormancy too early and increase the risk of sunburn, which hurts the appearance and quality of apples.\\nThat’s why, on a chilly day in December, van Nocker and graduate assistant Lily “Kaz” Christian hiked through a public park near Michigan State to check on a handful of Malus coronaria trees they had found there.\\nMalus coronaria – also called sweet crabapple -- was once so common in Michigan its blossoms were designated as the state flower in 1897. But the species appears to be in decline, van Nocker said. Parking lots and shopping centers now stand in many of the places where the tree was documented in the past, and the remaining trees often produce little new growth or fruit.\\nWhen they reached the trees, van Nocker and Christian cut off small pieces of the stems. The snippets will be tested to ensure they are fully Malus coronaria and not a hybrid. Then, these Malus coronaria cuttings — along with cuttings from previous hunts — will be grafted onto an apple rootstock. That will allow them to grow into trees which are identical to the original.\\nHowever, the goal is not to replace popular varieties like Fuji or Honeycrisp with Malus coronaria apples, since the Michigan tree’s fruit is small, green and bitter.\\n“To me, they don’t taste good at all,” van Nocker said.\\nInstead, he wants to identify the genes that cause late blooming and create a genetic stock that breeders could use to develop commercial apples. Van Nocker also is sending seeds to the U.S. Department of Agriculture so the genetic stock won’t be lost if the tree continues to decline.\\nMaking a later-blooming commercial apple could take decades. If a Malus coronaria is crossed with a commercial apple tree to make a new hybrid, it would take four or five years for that tree to start producing apples. Crossbreeding would continue until researchers developed an apple with the desired traits of both varieties.\\nBut van Nocker said it’s critical to try.\\n“With climate change, it’s quite possible that apples won’t be able to be produced in Michigan in the future,” he said. “That’s why cultivar improvement, especially in terms of frost resistance, is so important.”'},\n",
