            "content": "A man who has owned the same Ford Capri since 1974 says the emotional attachment he has for the vehicle makes it \"part of the family\".\nMr Doyle from Pyne near Exeter originally bought the 1969 Capri second-hand for Â£625 and has since spent more than Â£40,000 restoring it to \"better than factory\" condition.\nHe considered scrapping the car in 2012 due to its poor condition but credits his late wife Kath for her \"amazing vision\" in persuading him to keep and restore it.\nAffectionately known as Bessie, he said the car evokes \"quite powerful memories for people\" when he takes it to classic car shows.\nIn 1974 Mr Doyle owned a two-seater Austin Healey Sprite but he needed \"something bigger\" as his wife Kath was expecting their first child.\n\"Of course, children, babies, two seater sports cars, they don't go well together,\" he said.\n\"I always fancied the Capri, the problem is that I've now got to fit a pram into the back of this car.\"\nHe managed to squeeze the pram in with an inch to spare thanks to taking the wheels off.\n\"The top of the pram went on the back seat with no seatbelt on it in those days and the baby rolls around,\" he said.\n\"It's probably why my daughter's got a bad neck.\"\nOriginally from London, he has fond memories of taking the car out for a drive around Heathrow Airport's tunnels.\n\"Back in 1974 I would say to my then wife, 'I'm popping out for half an hour', 'I know where you're going she would say',\" said Mr Doyle.\nHe would drive the car through the tunnels with the windows down to listen to the engine.\n\"If you wanted to add a bit of throttle, you could drift the back end out, but that was back then,\" he said.\n\"I don't do it now, I treat her with the utmost respect because she's an old lady.\"\nThe car was driven daily between 1974 and 1991 until it broke down and had to be recovered.\nIt was off the road until 2012 when Mr Doyle considered scrapping it.\n\"It was my late wife Kath whose persuasion stopped me from scrapping the car,\" he said.\n\"I'm forever indebted to her amazing vision.\"\nThe car was \"taken back to a shell\" and fully restored over two years.\n\"She's probably in better condition than when she left the factory in 1969,\" he said.\nMr Doyle said his car helps him to connect with people.\n\"You go to a show and you get these retired guys come up and say 'I used to work in the factory where these parts were made',\" he said.\n\"It's suddenly, bang, memories and they light up and tell you all these stories.\n\"These old cars have this connection in evoking quite powerful memories for people and I find that brilliant.\"\nHe added: \"I know it's an inanimate object but it's part of the family.\"\nFollow BBC Devon on X, external, Facebook, external and Instagram, external.

            "content": "The leader of Ontario, Doug Ford, has vowed to push back at US President Donald Trump after securing a third term in office as premier of Canada's most populous province.\n\"Donald Trump thinks he can break us,\" he told the cheering crowds in Toronto, but the US president was mistaken, he added. \"Canada is not for sale.\"\nFord, who has led Ontario since 2018, called the snap election to get a clear mandate to fight US President Donald Trump over tariffs he threatens to impose on Canadian goods.\nThe indications on Friday morning were that his Progressive Conservatives had won more than 80 seats out of 124 in the legislature.\n\nThe left-wing New Democratic Party came second, forming the official opposition, while the Liberals were in third place.\nFord pushed back in his election campaign against Trump's persistent references to Canada as the 51st US state, sporting a cap saying \"Canada is not for sale.\"\nIn his victory speech at a convention centre in Toronto, he said:  \"Donald Trump thinks he can break us. He thinks he can divide and conquer, pit region against region.\n\"Donald Trump doesn't know what we know. He is underestimating us. He is underestimating the resilience of the Canadian people, the Canadian spirit.\"\nThe election was called by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) 10 minutes after polls closed on Thursday evening.\nVoter turnout appears to be near historic lows. As of 23:00 local time (04:00 GMT) with 97% of polls reporting, just over 44% of Ontarians had cast ballots in the election.\nThat is essentially tied with the lowest ever turnout of 44% in 2022.\nFord ran his campaign under the slogan \"Protect Canada\", reflecting his view that Canada needs to stand firm against US tariff threats.\nTrump says US will impose additional 10% tariff on China\nFord has appeared regularly on US television news networks in recent months as a de-facto spokesman for Canada's position in its fight against the tariffs.\nPresident Trump said on Thursday that the tariffs he planned to impose on Canada and Mexico would go ahead next week, after he delayed them a month in exchange for security assurances at the shared borders.\nAround 75% of Canadian exports go to the US, and economists have warned that the tariffs would be devastating for Canada's economy while raising costs for Americans.\nOntario is home to a large automotive sector that is deeply intertwined with the US - car parts often make several trips back and forth across the US-Canada border before a vehicle is fully assembled and sold.\nFord has suggested that 500,000 of Ontario's 16 million people could lose their jobs if the US follows through on the blanket 25% tariffs.\nHe has called for strong retaliation, suggesting Canada cut its energy supply to the US and calling for provincial liquor stores to pull American booze from their shelves.\nHe has also proposed the idea of \"Fortress Am-Can\" - a slogan to sell Trump on a stronger energy alliance between the two countries in a bid to avoid tariffs altogether.\nOpposition parties have criticised Ford for calling the snap election, accusing him of taking advantage of the rift in US-Canada relations to boost his own popularity. They also questioned the decision to push for a costly election amid economic uncertainty.\nFord has also been the subject of numerous  controversies, including an ongoing criminal investigation into a deal to sell a piece of environmentally protected land for real estate development.\nAt a speech to supporters on Thursday, Bonnie Crombie, leader of the Ontario Liberals, said that while the party fell short of forming a government it should be \"very proud\" of the seats it gained.\n\"People counted us out. Tonight, you proved them wrong,\" said Crombie, who failed to win her own seat. She vowed to continue on as leader.\nThe last time a government in Ontario formed three consecutive majorities was under Leslie Frost, a Progressive Conservative leader who won his third and final term in 1959.",

            "title": "Edmunds’ family SUV test: 2025 Ford Explorer vs. 2025 Honda Pilot",
            "content": "The 2025 Ford Explorer and 2025 Honda Pilot are midsize SUVs with three rows of seating, available all-wheel drive, and cabins peppered with storage cubbies. In other words, they’re both highly practical means of running errands, coping with a commute, or tackling long road trips. But which one is the better buy?\nThis year’s Explorer is the best it’s been in quite some time. Ford has revised the styling, updated the interior and added some new technology features. Not much changes for the 2025 Pilot. But it’s still pretty fresh from its 2023 full redesign and is easy to consider a class benchmark. Edmunds automotive experts put these SUVs head-to-head to help you decide.\nServing as the Explorer’s standard powertrain is a 300-horsepower turbocharged four-cylinder engine. In its rear-wheel-drive configuration, the Explorer gets an EPA-estimated 24 mpg combined city/highway with this engine. Adding all-wheel drive drops this figure to 23 mpg.\nYou might not think a four-cylinder engine is up to the task of moving a big SUV, but it is here. You’ll have little trouble getting up to speed on the highway on-ramps or hauling the whole family. Edmunds has found in its testing the Explorer can get from zero to 60 mph in 7 seconds. There’s also an available 400-horsepower turbo V6 that really wakes things up. With it, the Explorer can zip to 60 mph in just 5.6 seconds.\nThe Honda Pilot is motivated by a 285-horsepower V6 that’s available with either front-wheel or all-wheel drive. A more powerful engine isn’t available. In testing, Edmunds found the Pilot isn’t as quick as the Explorer. It needed 7.8 seconds to get to 60 mph. At its most fuel-efficient, the Pilot delivers an EPA-estimated 22 mpg combined.\nWinner: Ford Explorer\nIn either the Explorer or Pilot, the best seats in the house are the front row. Edmunds found each SUV’s front seats to be comfortable and spacious, and they offer available features like heating and ventilating functions. Things are a little less appealing in back.\nEdmunds singled out the Explorer’s available captain’s chairs as being too narrow and skimpy with the cushion padding. The third row is similarly light on cushioning and short on adult-friendly legroom. This same criticism was leveled at the Pilot. While its second-row seating is more accommodating, its third row is similarly best suited for kids.\nOnboard technology favors the Explorer, however. Its new digital instrument display and 13.2-inch center touchscreen are significantly larger than anything offered in the Pilot. The Ford also holds the advantage of offering BlueCruise, which is a hands-free highway driving assist feature.\nWinner: Explorer\nAthletic handling is a contributing factor to the Explorer’s fun-to-drive manners. Turn-in is quick, and this Ford SUV feels sporty and stable around corners. Honda typically infuses its vehicles with a similar vibe, but the newest Pilot seemed to have been overlooked. It gets about without fuss, but you’re not really going to be excited about driving it.\nThe upside is that the Pilot has a smoother ride quality over bumps. In the Explorer, you’ll feel more road imperfections. The Pilot also has the advantage of being a bit better for recreational outdoor use, such as taking on dirt roads, in its adventure-themed TrailSport trim.\nWinner: Pilot\nEdmunds’ editors praise the Pilot’s abundance of storage compartments and its practical cabin design. Front passengers benefit from a huge center console, while second- and third-row occupants can use all sorts of storage nooks, trays and cupholders. Honda says the Pilot can hold 48.5 cubic feet of cargo behind its second-row seats.\nThe Explorer also has a solid number of bins and cubbies, along with handy underfloor storage in the cargo hold. They aren’t quite as useful as the Pilot’s, however. Behind the Explorer’s second-row seats is 46 cubic feet of cargo space.\nWinner: Pilot\nHonda starts the Pilot out with the base Sport trim at $41,650, including destination. For that, you get features including heated front seats, three-zone automatic climate control, and a helpful collection of advanced driver aids, such as adaptive cruise control and blind-spot warning. The Explorer’s base Active trim checks in at $41,350 and has a similar collection of features.\nNeither SUV really differentiates itself as you start to look at the more well-equipped trim levels that come with panoramic sunroofs, premium sound systems and more. The Pilot’s top Black Edition costs $56,030 and the Explorer’s Platinum trim is $55,855.\nWinner: tie\nEdmunds ultimately gives the slight edge to the Explorer in its midsize SUV rankings, but your desires could influence your final decision. The Explorer is sportier and more tech-forward while the Pilot is a bit more comfortable for daily driving.\nThis story was provided to The Associated Press by the automotive website Edmunds.

            "content": "Director Francis Ford Coppola, actor Viola Davis, director Paul Feig and and actor-director Clint Eastwood are among those paying tribute to Gene Hackman after his death at age 95. Hackman, his wife Betsy Arakawa and their dog were found dead in their New Mexico home, authorities said Thursday.\n“The loss of a great artist, always cause for both mourning and celebration: Gene Hackman a great actor, inspiring and magnificent in his work and complexity, I mourn his loss, and celebrate his existence and contribution.” — Francis Ford Coppola on Instagram.\n“There was no finer actor than Gene. Intense and instinctive. Never a false note. He was also a dear friend whom I will miss very much.” — actor-director Clint Eastwood in a statement.\nGene Hackman, the Oscar-winning actor whose roles ranged from reluctant heroes to conniving villains, was found dead along with his wife, Betsy Arakawa, and their dog. He was 95. What to know:\n“He was a tough nut, Gene Hackman, but he was really good and he was really difficult. Like, we can say it now, but he was a tough guy because older great actors do not give young directors much of a chance. They’re really rough on ’em.” — Bill Murray, recounting to The Associated Press Thursday how Hackman worked on the set of the “Royal Tenenbaums,” including doing multiple takes flawlessly when other performers didn’t nail the scene. “He was a great one. He was a great actor.”\n“There has never been a ‘Gene Hackman Type.’ There has only been Gene Hackman. — Actor Tom Hanks on Instagram.\n“We have lost a true legend. The magnificent Gene Hackman has passed away. A man whose breath of talent was immeasurable. Growing up on his movies was an absolute thrill for me. To observe his remarkable facility and humanity in every role was something to behold. Whatever film he was in, he made it better. A force of nature like no other and as such there will never be another like him.” — actor Cary Elwes.\n\n“The greatest ... ” — director Edgar Wright on X.\n“So awful. Gene was such an inspiration to so many of us who love movies. So many brilliant roles. His performance in ‘The Conversation’ alone changed the way I looked at acting and what actors could bring to a role. Such an amazing career. RIP Mr. Hackman.” — director Paul Feig on X.\n“Loved you in everything! ‘The Conversation,’ ‘The French Connection,’ ‘The Poseidon Adventure,’ ‘Unforgiven’ —tough yet vulnerable. You were one of the greats. God bless those who loved you. Rest well, sir.” — actor Viola Davis on Instagram.\n“One of the best, one of the very, very best, has passed. Everything you ever wanted to know and learn about the craft of screen acting could be found in any, ANY of his performances. ‘The French Connection.’ ‘Crimson Tide,’ ‘The Conversation.’ Gosh! I could go on… A master. — actor Steve Toussaint on Instagram.\n“I am crushed by the sudden deaths of Gene Hackman and his wife Betsy Arakawa (and their dog). Crushed. He was always one of my favorites. Not many who beat to their own drums like he did. Rest in Peace.” — actor Josh Brolin on Instagram.\n“A very sad day for the cinema’s family.” — Antonio Banderas on X.\n“Gene Hackman may have been known for playing the ‘tough guy,’ including the hard-nosed cop Jimmy ‘Popeye’ Doyle in ‘The French Connection’ and the supervillain Lex Luthor in ‘Superman,’ but he had a soft heart for animals. From joining PETA in opposing a plan to use 200 ‘retired’ chimpanzees in experiments to rescuing a pair of stray dogs who wandered onto the set of ‘The Replacements,’ Hackman used his remarkable gifts to make the world a kinder place for all.” — PETA Senior Vice President Lisa Lange in a statement.",

            "title": "Ron Nessen, press secretary to President Ford, dies at 90",
            "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Ron Nessen, a veteran broadcast journalist who was press secretary for President Gerald Ford and sought to restore the integrity that the position had lost during the Nixon administration, has died. He was 90.\nNessen died Wednesday in Bethesda, Maryland, his son, Edward Nessen, confirmed Friday.\nNessen replaced Jerald F. terHorst in September 1974 just six weeks into Ford’s presidency after terHorst resigned in protest over Ford’s pardon of former President Richard Nixon. Nessen had covered Ford’s tenure as vice president in the final months of a 12-year stint as a television correspondent with NBC News. He was the first journalist to come to the White House post from a broadcast background.\nNessen had developed a positive working relationship with Ford even though he asked difficult questions about the Watergate scandal as it eroded Nixon’s presidency. The position of press secretary, held then by Ron Ziegler, lacked credibility as the slow-moving scandal revealed a White House press operation that could not be trusted in its public pronouncements.\n“I will never knowingly lie to you, never knowingly mislead the White House press corps,” Nessen, then 40, told reporters when he took over as Ford’s spokesman. He added, “If I do, you’d be justified in questioning my usefulness in this job.” He also said he saw his main duty as providing news and information to the American people, not selling the president’s policies or necessarily agreeing with them.\nOne prominent trait for the new press secretary was a sense of humor. (He told reporters on his first day, “I’m a Ron, not a Ziegler,” a play off his boss’ remark that “I am a Ford, not a Lincoln.”) But, by his own admission, Nessen was at times short-tempered, thin-skinned and sarcastic when dealing with journalists.\n\nNessen later pointed with pride to getting reporters more access to the president, including allowing follow-up questions at news conferences and having Ford appear on a live network television news program. The appearance on NBC’s “Meet the Press” was a first for a president.\nDuring his two years and four months as White House press secretary, Nessen may have drawn the most attention to himself by hosting television’s “Saturday Night Live,” then in its initial season. He was the first “SNL” host to come from outside the entertainment world. The April 17, 1976, episode aired during Ford’s reelection bid and included taped appearances by the president, who likely hoped to come across as a good sport in the face of the show’s constant satirical jabs.\nThe post-broadcast criticism Nessen endured was mostly about the propriety and wisdom of a press secretary participating in a comedy show that skewered his boss, not Nessen’s ability to deliver a punch line. He later said he worried privately that hosting had been an ego-driven mistake since the liberal-leaning show’s skits continued mocking Ford as a bumbler and dullard.\nRonald H. Nessen was born May 25, 1934, in Washington. His father owned a general merchandise store in the city and his mother was its bookkeeper.\nNessen worked in radio as a high school student and while studying at Shepherd College in West Virginia and American University in Washington, where he received a bachelor’s degree in 1959. During the 1950s, he was a newscaster for WEPM in Martinsburg, West Virginia, and WARL in Arlington, Virginia, and later reported for the Montgomery County Sentinel in Rockville, Maryland.\nNessen was a reporter and editor for United Press International in Washington from 1956-62, then joined NBC News as a television correspondent. He covered Lyndon Johnson’s White House, civil rights and the 1964 presidential campaign and was sent to Vietnam five times, his first tour ending in a near-fatal chest wound from a grenade fragment. He also covered national affairs and international assignments for the network before focusing on the Ford vice presidency.\nAfter Ford’s defeat by Jimmy Carter in 1976, Nessen turned to writing and freelance work. He was a top executive with the Washington public relations firm Marston & Rothenberg Public Affairs from 1980-84 before managing radio news operations for the Mutual Broadcasting System and the NBC Radio Network. He later worked as a public affairs executive for the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association and the Brookings Institution.\nHe also wrote two memoirs, “It Sure Looks Different from the Inside” (1978) and “Making the News, Taking the News” (2011). He also wrote the novels “The First Lady” (1979) and “The Hour” (1984) as well as three mysteries in the 1990s co-written with his wife at the time, Johanna Neuman.\nLooking back on his career change, Nessen acknowledged in his 2011 memoir that he wanted the job as Ford’s spokesman in part to see what it was like to be a newsmaker. He concluded that he preferred the journalist’s role and wrote, “I’m more comfortable as an observer than as a participant.”\nNessen is survived by his son, daughter Caren Nessen, a sister, two grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.\n—-\nDaniel retired from The Associated Press in 2023.

(AP) — A select few are getting the chance to set their gaze on a slew of rarely seen Ford vehicles at the automaker’s Michigan headquarters.\nAbout 50 cars and trucks that are part of Ford Motor Co.'s Heritage Fleet are on display in Dearborn. Some employees checked them out Tuesday, and the media got a look Wednesday. And next month, they’ll be available for viewing as part of “Bring Your Child to Work Day.”\n“I’m so excited to be able to share these vehicles, because every one of these vehicles throughout this room are here because somebody, a passionate Ford employee, worked to have it preserved, worked to have it saved,” said Ted Ryan, Ford’s Heritage brand manager.\nFord has existing Heritage Fleets in the U.K., Germany and Australia.

These vehicles have a business purpose. They’re used by engineers. They’re used by our product development team. They’re used by our communications group. And every one of them has to have a reason that drives the business forward,” Ryan said.\n“Because we’re looking forward by looking back.”",

But in 2023, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration opened an investigation into those previous recalls after receiving 98 consumer complaints alleging that their Ford Focus sedans still lost power.\nThis fall, Ford began offering a customer satisfaction program that will replace the canister purge valve in the affected vehicles.

The company’s outlook calls for the EV unit to lose between $5 billion and $5.5 billion this year.\nFord said that the Model e segment’s losses are due in part to continued investment in future products, and touted $1.4 billion in net cost improvements even as the company increased spending to launch new battery plants and new electric vehicles.\nThe automaker laid out a similarly downbeat outlook for Ford Pro, its commercial vehicle unit, and Ford Blue, which makes gas and hybrid vehicles.\nThe automaker projects Ford Pro’s full-year pretax profit between $7.5 billion and $8 billion, down from $9.02 billion this year.

            "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — Wall Street drifted through mixed trading Thursday as rising fashion and cigarette stocks worked against drops for Ford Motor and Qualcomm.\nThe S&P 500 rose 0.4% following healthy gains for stock markets across much of Europe and Asia. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 125 points, or 0.3%, and the Nasdaq composite gained 0.5%.\nTapestry, the company behind the Coach and Kate Spade brands, helped lead the market and jumped 12%. It reported stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected after attracting new, younger customers. Tapestry also raised its forecast for revenue and profit growth this fiscal year.\nPhilip Morris International, which sells Marlboro cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products around the world, was one of the strongest forces pushing upward on the S&P 500 and rallied 10.9% after reporting a better profit than expected. It also gave financial forecasts that topped expectations, and analysts pointed in particular to strength for its Zyn nicotine pouches.\nThe AP’s Seth Sutel reports markets are looking for direction.\nThey helped offset a 7.5% drop for Ford Motor, which fell even though the automaker delivered a stronger profit and revenue for the latest quarter than analysts expected. Investors focused instead on Ford’s financial forecasts for 2025, which the company said incorporates “headwinds related to market factors.”\nThe company gave a forecasted range for how much cash it will generate this year whose midpoint fell below analysts’ expectations, for example.\n\nQualcomm also kept indexes in check after falling 3.7%. The company, whose products help power smartphones and other devices, reported profit for the latest quarter that topped analysts’ forecasts, and analysts called the performance solid. But they also said expectations were high, and worries are rising about the wireless chip industry broadly.\nIn the bond market, Treasury yields held relatively steady after a report said more U.S. workers filed for unemployment benefits  last week than expected, though the number remains low compared with history. A more comprehensive report will arrive on Friday, showing how many jobs U.S. employers added during the month of January.\nThe hope is Friday’s data will show a job market that remains solid enough to keep worries about a possible downturn at bay but not so strong that it pushes upward on inflation. The U.S. economy has remained much more solid than critics feared, but pressure is rising in part because of the threat of potential tariffs coming from President Donald Trump.\nAfter rocking financial markets around the world at the start of this week, worries about a potentially punishing global trade war have eased a bit after Trump gave 30-day reprieves for tariffs on both Mexico and Canada.\nWhile discussing Ford Motor’s earnings and financial forecasts, CEO Jim Farley said his company can manage a “few weeks” of tariffs of 25% on Canadian and Mexican imports. But if they’re protracted, they would have “a huge impact on our industry,” resulting in higher prices for customers, losses of U.S. jobs and the elimination of billions of dollars of industry profits.\nElsewhere on Wall Street, another company reliant on spending by consumers around the world, Ralph Lauren, rallied 9.7% after reporting stronger profit and revenue than expected. Growth was particularly strong in China, where the company recently opened stores in Hong Kong and Beijing.\nEli Lilly rose 3.3% after the drugmaker showed how demand for its hot-selling diabetes and obesity treatments is swelling its profits.\nSpecialist Dilip Patel works at his post on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, Tuesday, Feb. 4, 2025. (AP Photo/Richard Drew)\n\nHoneywell fell 5.6% and was one of the heaviest weights on the S&P 500. It announced it will split into three independent, publicly-traded companies, following in the footsteps of other conglomerates such as General Electric.\nThe North Carolina company, one of the few U.S. conglomerates still in existence, expects to complete the spin-off of its automation and aerospace technologies businesses sometime in late 2026.\nAll told, the S&P 500 rose 22.09 points to 6,083.57. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 125.65 to 44,747.63, and the Nasdaq composite rose 99.66 to 19,791.99.\nIn stock markets abroad, London’s FTSE 100 jumped 1.2% after the Bank of England cut its main interest rate  as it slashed its forecast for economic growth. The British economy has barely grown over the past six months, and the Bank of England halved its growth projection for the British economy this year to 0.75%.\nStock indexes also rose 1.5% in Paris, 1.4% in Hong Kong and 0.6% in Tokyo.\nIn Japan, Honda Motor Co. fell, and Nissan Motor Corp. rose after Japanese media said they were ditching their talks to set up a joint holding company. Neither company confirmed the report. An update on the talks is expected by mid-February, but no date has been set.\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury held steady at 4.43%, where it was late Wednesday.\nAP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama and Matt Ott contributed.",
